Dappnet is a bulletproof way to deploy websites and applications to the web, that canâ€™t be censored, captured or taken down.

With one install, your browser is upgraded to access .eth domain names on ENS, and load their content from a P2P network called IPFS. You don't have to configure anything.

ENS names can't be seized, and IPFS cannot be censored. When one node is censored on IPFS, others can take its place, permissionlessly.

Dappnet runs a local IPFS node and a local Ethereum light node, meaning there is no reliance on an external provider. Your internet connection is all you need to access the Dappnet.
